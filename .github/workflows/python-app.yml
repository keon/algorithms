MOG Eternal Operation Manual

Version: 1.0 | Date: October 2025


---

1. System Overview

The MOG ecosystem consists of:

1. ERC-20 MOG Token – Native currency for transactions, staking, and NFT minting.


2. NFT Creation Engine – Mint dynamic NFTs with metadata and RWDA links.


3. RWDA (Real-World Digital Assets) – Functional assets tied to NFTs (merch, tickets, subscriptions).


4. AI Orchestration Node – Autonomous monitoring, reward distribution, validation, and error correction.


5. DAO Governance – Community-driven voting and upgrade system.


6. DeFi Utilities – Staking pools, yield farming, NFT/RWDA staking.


7. Community Portal – Frontend access for NFT minting, RWDA claim, staking, and voting.



The system is fully autonomous and distributed, with redundancy to ensure eternal uptime.


---

2. Eternal Upgrade & Expansion Principles

Decentralized Governance: All upgrades and additions require DAO approval.

AI Validation: AI agents automatically validate transactions, NFT minting, and RWDA usage.

Modular Architecture: Each component (NFT Engine, RWDA, DeFi, AI, DAO) can be upgraded independently.

Redundant Nodes: Deploy at least 3 global nodes to prevent downtime.

Automated Watchdog: Monitors all services, restarting failed components.



---

3. Adding New NFTs

Step 1: Define NFT Metadata

1. Create JSON metadata in config/nft_metadata.json:



{
  "NFT_004": {
    "name": "Mog Special Edition",
    "description": "Exclusive RWDA-linked NFT",
    "image": "https://example.com/nft004.png",
    "attributes": [{"trait_type": "Rarity", "value": "Legendary"}]
  }
}

Step 2: Configure RWDA

1. Update config/rwda_links.json with new NFT-RWDA mapping:



{
  "NFT_004": "RWDA_Merch_004"
}

Step 3: Deploy NFT via Smart Contract

cd contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/mint_nft.js --network mainnet --nft_id NFT_004 --metadata ../config/nft_metadata.json

Step 4: Update Frontend

cd frontend
cp ../config/nft_metadata.json src/config.json
cp ../config/rwda_links.json src/rwda_links.json
npm run build


---

4. Adding New RWDA

1. Define RWDA functionality (merch, ticket, subscription).


2. Update config/rwda_links.json to link NFT IDs to new RWDA assets.


3. Deploy RWDA smart contract if new types are added:



cd contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_rwda.js --network mainnet


---

5. Adding or Updating DeFi Utilities

1. Staking Pools: Deploy new pool for new token/NFT/RWDA combination:



cd scripts/defi
python deploy_staking_pool.py --token_address 0xMOGTOKENADDRESS --nft_id NFT_004

2. Yield Farming: Configure reward rates for new pools:



python deploy_yield_farmin
