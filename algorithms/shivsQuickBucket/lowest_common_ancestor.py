"""
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor
(LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
    “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes
    v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as
    descendants
    (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

         7   4
For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5,
since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
