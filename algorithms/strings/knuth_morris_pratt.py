    """
    Given two strings text and pattern, return the list of start indexes in text that matches with the pattern
    using knuth_morris_pratt algorithm.

    Args:
        text: Text to search
        pattern: Pattern to search in the text
    Returns:
        List of indices of patterns found

    Example:
        >>> knuth_morris_pratt('hello there hero!', 'he')
        [0, 7, 12]

    If idx is in the list, text[idx : idx + M] matches with pattern.
    Time complexity of the algorithm is O(N+M), with N and M the length of text and pattern, respectively.
